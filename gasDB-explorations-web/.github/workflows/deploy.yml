      - name: Render Quarto site
        run: |
          quarto render

      # Step 4: Install Staticrypt (in case itâ€™s not available on the runner)
        # This ensures Staticrypt is available for encryption.
      - name: Install Staticrypt
        run: |
          npm install -g staticrypt

      # Step 5: Encrypt index.html using Staticrypt with a password from GitHub Secrets
